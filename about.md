# About Me

Hello! My name is Neha Modi. I study at the University of Washington. This page says a little about me.

## Academics

I am a freshman majoring in **Computer Science**. I intent to double major in *Statistics* and will be applying into the major this Spring. 

Here are the classes I'm taking this quarter at UW:

- [Systems & Software Tools](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse391/)
- [Intro to Computer Programming](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse123/)
- [Computer Ethics](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse480/)
- [Software Documentation](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/ENGL396)
- [Intro to Probability](https://stat.uw.edu/academics/course-catalog/stat-394)

## Programming Background

I am relatively new to programming. The following table summarizes my experience with different programming languages:

| Language | Experience |
|---------:|------------|
| Python   | Intro to Neuro/AI Course + Science Olympiad App|
| Java     | Up to CSE 123, but most comfortable language |
| R        | STAT 311 + STAT 394|


## Words of Wisdom

One of my favorite quotes is from Kurt Vonnegut:

> "Another flaw in the human character is that everyone wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance."
