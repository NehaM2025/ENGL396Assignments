    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <p>This page says a bit more about me.</p>
    
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>When I am not studying, I like to read mystery books, watching romances movies, dancing to music, and trying new eggless baking experiments.</p>

  <p>These are my <strong>favorite</strong> romance movies (off the top of my head right now):
   <ul>
    <li>Titanic (1997)</li>
    <li>Anastasia (1997)</li>
    <li>The People We Meet on Vacation (2026)</li>
    <li>Fault In Our Stars (2014)</li>
   </ul>
  </p> 
  <p>I also love making things from scratch</p>

<h2>Baking</h2>
  <p>I am a terrible cook, but I can bake some simple things. Here is my favorite before & after:</p>
