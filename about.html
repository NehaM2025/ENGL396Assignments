    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <p>This page says a bit more about me.</p>
    
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>When I am not studying, I like reading mystery books, binge watching new TV shows, dancing to pop music, and trying new eggless baking experiments.</p>

  <p>The table below shows my <strong>favorite</strong> shows of the ones I watched this past summer:</p> 
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>TV Show Name</th>
        <th># of Seasons</th>
        <th>Best Season</th>
        
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stranger Things</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Avatar: The Last Airbender</td>

<h2>Baking</h2>
  <p>Although I am a terrible cook, I can bake some simple things. Here is my favorite before & after of eggless chocolate chip cookies</p>
