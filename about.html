    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <p>This page says a bit more about me.</p>
    
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>When I am not studying, I like reading mystery books, binge watching TV shows, dancing to pop music, and trying new eggless baking experiments.</p>

    <p>These are my <strong>favorite</strong> books:
   <ul>
    <li>Instructions for Dancing</li>
    <li>The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes</li>
    <li>The Mysterious Benedict Society</li>
    <li>The Great Gatsby</li>
   </ul>
  </p> 

  <p>The table below shows my thoughts on the TV shows I watched <i>this past summer</i>:</p> 
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>TV Show Name</th>
        <th>Worst Season</th>
        <th>Best Season</th>
        
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80057281">Stranger Things</a></td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Avatar: The Last Airbender</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The Summer I Turned Pretty</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Wednesday</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
  <p>I also love building projects from scratch. For a highschool compeitition, I made a functional mass-force sensing device (glorified scale)</p>

<h2>Baking</h2>
  <p>Although I am a terrible cook, I can bake some simple things. Here is my favorite before & after eggless chocolate chip cookies:</p>
